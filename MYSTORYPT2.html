  <p class="font-italic text-center">My third trimester appointments got started with my VBAC supportive doctor Dr.Sreedevi,Fernandez Hospital(Hyderabad,India).</p>
  <p class="font-weight-light text-center">My Doctor wasn't against VBAC but she always made me aware of the risks involved with it & said that it is you who can do it & not us.
</p>

<p class="font-weight-light text-center">I was more involved in everything of my pregnancy,I would make a to-do list of my diet & exercises everyday & keep myself motivated,my Amani childbirth educator & doula friend was Zahra Batool</p>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">And then came the preparation of my birthplan,

My birthplan included things like,

No episiotomy unless needed,

skin to skin contact after birth,

breastfeeding,</P>

<P class="font-italic text-center">quiet environment,

upright birthing position,

freedom of movement to name a few.</P>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">I started discussing my birthplan with my doctor,she agreed to most of the things except to freedom of movement,as I was trying for TOLAC she wanted me to be monitored most of the time
</P>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">I was also interested in meeting midwifery healthcare as I was more into having a pro natural birth.they were very supportive from the start & would always uplift me by appreciating my efforts.

we talked with them & insisted on having intermittent monitoring during labor.</P>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">
It was also generous of them to conduct a hypnobirthing session for me,although I am not much into hypnobirthing but a session of hypnobirthing during my labor really helped me progress my contractions & stay relaxed & focused.</P>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">
My husband arrived just 10 days before my due date,my birth team was complete now.we would have sessions together with the doctor,midwives & my doula where in we discussed so much about labor.</P>

<P class="font-weight-light text-center">As 9th month got started,I was taking about 7 dates a day,doing more of walking,squatting,stairs climbing, bouncing & swaying on ball,pelvic tilts & pelvic floor exercises(note-I've already been doing these exercises since my 30th week)</P>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">Also started with perineal massage at around 36 weeks twice a week,duck walk alternatively just 2 weeks before my due date along with accupressure massage techniques,essential oils (clary sage was my favourite),intercourse & nipple stimulation to induce labor.</P>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">I was having false pains since my 38th week but because they weren't progressing I was sure about them to be false.I was scheduled for a membrane sweep at about 39+5 days just 2 days before my due date.</P>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">
Stay tuned to know about my labor story in the next part.</P>
