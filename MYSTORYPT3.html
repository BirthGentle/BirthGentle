  <p class="font-italic text-center">LABOR STORY</p>

<p class="font-weight-light text-center">
I was called for a membrane sweep at about 39+5 weeks & just before heading to the hospital my pains got started at about 5 to 10 minutes apart,10 am in the morning...I would hold on to one place & practice rhythmic breathing with every contraction.</p>
  <p class="font-weight-light text-center">They were slowing down a little in between.my doula was there with me in no time,she suggested me to have hot shower & squat in between the contractions when in shower.I followed her.I did my lunch,and was having dates & zamzam in between.
</p>

<p class="font-weight-light text-center">Contractions started coming every 5 minutes apart,I would bounce & walk easily at this moment.my doula helped me deal with my contractions using hot water bag,accupressure massager & put clary sage on my forehead that allowed me to calm down a little</p>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">We thought it's better to head to the hospital & get it checked at this moment.On examination they said that my cervix is only soft & not dilated & they sent us back home</P>

<P class="font-italic text-center">We came back home at around & started making extra efforts for the labor to progress,.</P>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">Walking,stairs climbing,hips swaying,bouncing on ball,squatting & taking rest in between.my doula made sure of the environment I was desiring of,with some positive affirmations hanged on to the wall.I would read them & would say myself that I can do it back again.simultaneously I was also taking rest in between.</P>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">At around 11pm we noticed my contractions to be more stronger at about 1 to 2 minutes apart,we again drove back to the hospital..</P>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">
I was checked & I was only 1 cm dilated,but they wanted me to be admitted as my contractions were very intense..</P>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">
Intermittent monitoring got started.</P>

<P class="font-weight-light text-center">I was already exhausted,I wasn't able to walk around much & do anything.I was depressed because I was only 1cm with this much of pain.)</P>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">An hour later I also had a session of hypnobirthing with the midwife of the hospital,I was calm,I was relaxed but with each contraction I would vocalize.

They checked me back again & said that I was 2 cms now..We were happy that the contractions were progressing,we thanked the midwife for the session of hypnobirthing as it really helped me keep calm & release some more oxytocin.</P>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">I wasn't able to have anything at this moment,I was vomiting badly,I was put on IV.

I was in pain the whole night with intermittent monitoring in between,I was mostly on bed,but tried hard moving around in between.</P>
<P class="font-weight-light text-center">
I would still vocalise with every contraction,at this moment the effect of hot water bag was nil as the pains were only getting intense & stronger.my doula would encourage me with positive words,my husband would play quran,I would take a nap listening to quran..</P>
<p class="font-weight-light text-center">Early morning when they checked me back again at 5 am I was 4cms,sigh of relief.Waters broke at 9 am & soon I was 10 cms dilated in no time.</p>
<p class="font-weight-light text-center">I started feeling the urge to push..my husband came forward to hold me from my back,felt like we worked as a team to have our baby out. midwives encouraged me to push at the right time & I could feel my baby breathing out.</p>
<p class="font-weight-light text-center">I could feel my baby’s head soon,I started gaining my energy after feeling my baby.I gave all of my determination to have the baby out.</p>
<p class="font-weight-light text-center">Everyone shouted yes,yes you can do it,baby is almost out & it was just one last push.

It was around 12:29pm baby entered into this world,they laid her on my chest,she could feel the warmth of her mumma & started crying.</p>
<p class="font-weight-light text-center">Happiness rolled around the room,it was the most beautiful moment of my life to hold my baby in my arms  & with husband by my side.</p>
<p class="font-weight-light text-center">Midwives checked for any tears during birth as episiotomy wasn’t done,they weren't any Alhamdulillah.It was a complete natural birth with no medications & intact perineum.All praise is to Allah alone.</p>
<p class="font-weight-light text-center">we were also keen about delayed cord clamping, Daddy was happy to cut the cord.</p>
<p class="font-weight-light text-center">We made it till here,I believed in the power of dua,I thanked Allah,I thanked everyone from my birth team,without them this wouldn't have been possible.</p>
